Curriculum Vitae : Andrei Rykhlevskii
----------------------------------

This repository contains my curriculum vitae source files.

A current pdf can usually be found on my website :

https://github.com/andrewryh/CV/blob/master/cv.pdf

In order to build my cv from the source, try latex or pdflatex.

Thanks for your interest.
Also, thanks to the individuals responsible for the resume.cls file utilized
here and to Kathryn Huff template code I borrowed.
